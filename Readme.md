## 🚀 Project Overview
**AI-Powered Online JavaScript Compiler** is an intelligent, interactive coding platform that allows users to **write, execute, and receive personalized AI feedback** on their JavaScript code — all in real time.

It combines a **React frontend** with a **Spring Boot backend**, integrated with an **AI engine** for smart error detection, learning suggestions, and performance tracking.

> 💡 _Empowering developers to learn smarter, code faster, and grow stronger._

---

## ✨ Features
- 🧠 **AI-driven feedback** for personalized learning  
- 💻 **Interactive editor** built with Monaco or CodeMirror  
- ⚡ **Real-time JavaScript execution** in a sandboxed environment  
- 🔗 **RESTful API** for frontend-backend communication  
- 📊 **Progress tracking & analytics dashboard**  
- 📱 **Modern and responsive UI**  

---

## 🧩 System Architecture

### 🖥️ Frontend (React.js)
- User-friendly coding interface with live output display  
- Syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and real-time error display  

### ⚙️ Backend (Spring Boot)
- Handles code execution requests via REST APIs  
- Manages user authentication and data storage  
- Processes AI feedback and learning insights  

### 🤖 AI Module
- Learns from code submissions and identifies common mistakes  
- Suggests improvement tips and targeted exercises

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technologies |
|-------|---------------|
| **Frontend** | React.js, javaScript, Monaco Editor |
| **Backend** | Spring Boot, Java, RESTful APIs |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL / MongoDB |
| **AI Tools** | TensorFlow, scikit-learn |
| **Deployment** | Docker, AWS / Render |

---

## 🧠 AI Integration Plan
The AI module continuously improves through user interactions:

1. User submits code.  
2. Backend executes and logs output/errors.  
3. AI model analyzes issues (syntax, logic, inefficiency).  
4. Personalized suggestions and exercises are generated.  
5. Over time, AI adapts to user performance trends.

> 🧩 The goal: **Smarter code feedback** that evolves with each learner.

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- 🌍 Multi-language support (C, Python, Java, javaScript)  
- 🏅 Gamification — badges, XP, and leaderboards  
- 👥 Community-driven features (code sharing, peer review)  
- 🧾 Style and optimization improvement suggestions  
- 🎙️ Speech-to-code accessibility
